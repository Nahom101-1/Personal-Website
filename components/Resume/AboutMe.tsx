        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I am a second-year programming student at NTNU Gjøvik with a passion
          for software development. I am eager to learn and grow, particularly
          in web development, both frontend and backend. Although I am not an
          experienced developer, I am highly motivated to improve my skills and
          gain real-world experience through hands-on learning.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          In my free time, I have dabbled in React, and through school, I’ve
          gained experience with C++. While I may not have a lot of experience,
          I thrive in collaborative environments and am always ready to take on
          new challenges. I believe that working with others and learning by
          doing are the best ways to grow as a developer.
        </p>

          My goal in seeking an internship is to gain practical, real-world
          experience that goes beyond what I learn in the classroom. I’m excited
          to work with professionals in the field, contribute to meaningful
          projects, and continue to grow as a software developer. In the long
          term, I aim to become a well-rounded developer who can work on both
          the frontend and backend of applications.
